## ðŸš§ Still Under Construction ðŸš§ 

Command Database (CMDB for short!) is an easy-to-use reference guide for Minecraft Java commands, MCFunctions and NBT structuring. We have syntax guides for every Minecraft command, and guides on how to make your own datapack! These guides cover things like crafting recipes, advancements, loot tables and some custom items!

If you're looking for information on Minecraft Worldgen Datapacks, go check out [Apollo's Worldgen Docs](https://apollodatapacks.github.io/worldgen-docs/). She's doing an amazing job documenting it, as no one else has tried to do it before her!
